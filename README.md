# tinylinalg
Minimal linear algebra library for use in graphics and game projects (aka reinvention of the wheel).

This project is an excercise at using templates and GoogleTest. Vectors can be of arbitrary dimensions and have components of types that satisfy `std::integral<T> || std::floating_point<T>`. I tried keeping the Vector class as generic as possible to avoid code duplication (e.g., for addition operator, since addition is done the same way for vectors of all dimensions). Sadly, there is still a lot of code duplication in the implementation of arithmetical operators. Partial specializations for 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors are solely for the purpose of providing a nice way to access their components by name (e.g., `vec.x` and `vec.y`). This is done with anonymous structs which are not a part of ISO C++.

Currently, the code heavily uses loops for component-wise and similar operations, and relies on the compiler unrolling them which is not ideal. Compilers generally should unroll the loops (at least for small vectors) since the total number of iterations is always known.
